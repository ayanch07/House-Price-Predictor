    <p>In India, Investment in Real-Estate property has increased rapidly in recent times, and house prices fluctuate significantly based on location and amenities. Traditional house price prediction is based on “cost and sale price comparison,” lacking an accepted standard and a certification process. Therefore, the availability of an efficient house price prediction model is essential to fill in the Information Gap. It will improve the efficiency of the real estate market by catering to both the buyers and the retailers. It will help the buyers make an easy and intelligent choice and the retailers to be upfront in the market. This project aims to deliver a user-friendly platform to predict house prices using Machine Learning models. It implements three precise and widely used ML techniques: Random Forest, Linear Regression, and XG Boost. Taking care of all the necessary parameters, the model suggests the best of these three models to the user to get optimal results. As far as versatility is concerned, we primarily are targeting six major Indian metropolitan cities, viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad. This project also aims to do an extensive literature review and comparative study of the various available technologies related to the prediction of house prices using machine learning models.</p>
